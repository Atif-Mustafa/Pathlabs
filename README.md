## üöÄ Dr. Lal PathLabs Home Page Website Project

### üìå Overview
Welcome to the **Dr. Lal PathLabs Home Page** project! This project aims to replicate and enhance the "Home Page" section of the Dr. Lal PathLabs website. By recreating this section, we intend to showcase the platform's testing types, testing centres and much more.

### Home Page Consists of:

3. **Programs**
4. **Test Packages**
5. **Search Test And Packages**
6. **Why Dr. Lal Pathlabs**

In all these sections, we aim to mirror the original Dr. Lal PathLabs website's "Home Page."
